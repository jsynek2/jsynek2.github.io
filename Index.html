<h2><title>About</title> About</h2>  
<p class="About">
    <strong>Bubbie<em> (aka Rengar)</em></strong> is my cat. I have had him for around 2 years now and he makes my life better.
He like to flop in my arms when I hold him and he knows how to play fetch. He loves to follow me around the house and likes to be around people.
He is treated like a prince at my parents house, and although he loves my family, him and I have a special bond.

<p class="Hobbies">
   Some of<strong> Bubbie's </strong>favorite activities include being brushed in the sun, playing fetch and hunt the mousie, and prowling for bugs around the house.
    He usually likes to go on the prowl after my mom has smothered him with love and he needs alone time. One thing he does is immobilizes the bugs around the house and comes to get your attention to show you.
    This, along with the butt shake he does before he pounces, is what won my dad over.
